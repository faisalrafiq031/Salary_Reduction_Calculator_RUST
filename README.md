<h1>Salary Reduction Calculator</h1>

This Rust program calculates the percentage decrease between an original salary and a new, decreased salary. It prompts the user to enter their original salary and the new salary after a reduction. The program then computes the percentage decrease to show the impact of the decrease relative to the original salary.

**How It Works**

<li>Prompt for Original Salary: The program first asks the user to input their original salary.</li>
<li>Prompt for New Salary: It then requests the user's new decreased salary.</li>

<h2>Calculate Percentage Decrease: Using the formula</h2>

 <div class="formula">
        <h4>Calculate Percentage Decrease:</h4>
        <p>Percentage Decrease = ((Original Salary - New Salary) / Original Salary) Ã— 100</p>
 </div>

it calculates the percentage reduction in salary.

**Display Results:** Finally, it displays the original salary, new decreased salary, and calculated percentage decrease.

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

**If a user inputs:**

<li>Original Salary: 50,000</li>
<li>New Decreased Salary: 40,000</li>

**The output will be:**

<pre><code>Original Salary: 50000.00
New Decreased Salary: 40000.00
Percentage Decrease: 20.00%</code></pre>

This output shows that the salary was reduced by 20% from the original amount. This tool is useful for anyone wanting to understand the percentage impact of a reduction on their original income.
